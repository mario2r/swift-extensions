During my work career as swift developer I have faced lot of situations where some extensions are needed to avoid code duplication

## Installation

Add this project on your `Package.swift`

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/mario2r/swift-extensions.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ]
)
